# The List

This is a project that was born out of the deperate need of an app to help groups of people decide what to watch on Netflix.

Users sign up, create a group, invite their friends, make lists of movies (or anything), then vote on which one they most want as a group.

It was built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, Redux and a few other nifty little packages.
